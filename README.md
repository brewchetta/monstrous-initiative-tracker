# Monstrous D&D Initiative Tracker

Version 1.0

Initiative tracker for D&D. Utilizes the 5th Edition API to automatically pull in monster and spell stats. You can save "favorites" to local storage and retrieve them as need be. Additionally, you can create characters and use track their initiative as player characters.

## Planned Changes

- Player characters have specific styling to denote them

- Player character initiative card background is determined by class

- Users can assign icons to monsters / characters to show different statuses

- Option to use derived hit points or standard hit points

## Issues

- Cannot amend temporary hit points from initiative card
